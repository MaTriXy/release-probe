# ReleaseProbe
An Android app for monitoring new releases of libraries and dependencies such as AndroidX, Firebase and other popular 3rd party libraries on GitHub. Get notified when your favorite library has a new release.

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to experiment with some of the latest technologies including, libraries, architecture, infrastructure, tooling, design patterns in Android development, and apply them in a non-trivial project. Therefore it's expected that the focus will be mostly on the technologies rather than adding new features. Current tech stack is documented below.
